Android Bus Reference for NDSU Campus

This is an Android app that I've been messing around with in my free time.
I wanted to teach myself  Android development and decided to get started
by using an idea for an app I've had for quite a while.

This app is meant to be a reference for people using the MAT Bus on the 
NDSU campus. This idea came about because the Fargo bus system does not
present it's route schedules to passengers in a useful (in my opinion)
way. I thought there should be an easy reference you can use online or
at least on your phone so I decided to make one myself.

It uses the phone's GPS location to find the nearest bus stop
and provides information to the user such as distance to the bus stop, 
the time the bus will arrive there, and how long until the bus arrives there.
Users can launch Google Maps to see where that bus stop is as well.

Users can also choose to pick a specific bus stop on their route to see when
the next arrival will be there, even if it's not the closest location.

The app only supports 4 routes on the NDSU campus at the moment because at
this point in time, it's just meant to be a proof of concept. This was meant
to give me an excuse to learn some Android dev and I've had a lot of fun
doing it. :)
